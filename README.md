# Push_swap

Welcome to the Push_swap project repository by malescordia.

## Overview
Push_swap is a sorting algorithm project at 42, where the challenge is to sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations with the minimum number of moves. The project focuses on algorithmic efficiency, problem-solving, and understanding the complexities of sorting.

## Project Highlights
- Implements various sorting algorithms efficiently.
- Utilizes two stacks and a set of operations to manipulate the data.
- Minimizes the number of moves to achieve a sorted stack.
- Written in C as part of the 42 curriculum.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/malescordia/push_swap.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd push_swap`
3. Compile the program: `make`
4. Run with a list of integers: `./push_swap 5 2 8 3`

Happy sorting!
